# ultimate-image-processor
Ultimate image processing package used for optimizing images of 2D nanomaterials and generating essential inputs for machine learning applications; however, many of the features and functionalities included here can be used to improve image quality, segment distinct sections of images, and optimize inputs for machine learning applications.

>Note: The ideal run order for the processes in my scenario is:
1. Denoise
2. (Optional) Flatten
3. Generate Gray Images
4. Normalize
5. Generate Masks
There will be more processes to come!
